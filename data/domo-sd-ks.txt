Domo SDKs
An SDK (software development kit) is a collection of tools that can be used to build software for a specific platform. Domo officially supports both Java and Python SDKs, which provide quick paths for developing on top of Domo's APIs.
Java
Visit the Java SDK Repository for full usage and examples.
The Java SDK is published to Maven and can be added to your project in three ways:
Maven
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.domo</groupId>
  <artifactId>domo-java-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
Gradle
compile 'com.domo:domo-java-sdk:0.1.0'
Classic Jar Import
Clone the Java SDK Repository
Using a Bash Terminal, navigate to the cloned repository folder
Create the Jar files via the Bash command ./gradlew bootRepackage
The Jars will be located in build/libs/
Copy the Jars to your project folder, and add them to your build path
Python
Visit the Python SDK Repository for full usage and examples.
The Python SDK is published to PyPI, and can be installed via the Pip command:
pip3 install pydomo requests jsonpickle
Once installed, the SDK can be added to your project via:
from pydomo import Domo
R
The Domo R SDK (rdomo) lets you interact with Domo APIs from R for tasks like managing DataSets, users, groups, and more.
See the official repository for installation and usage: https://github.com/domoinc/rdomo
