The page object
The page object is a screen where you can view a “collection” of data, which is typically displayed in cards. You use a page to organize, manage, and share content to other users in Domo. Pages allow you to send external reports, create holistic filters across all metrics within the page, or have conversations in Domo’s Buzz tool about the data associated to the entire page. The Page API allows you to create, delete, retrieve a page or a list of pages, and update page information and content within a page.
