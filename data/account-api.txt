The Account Object
The Account API allows you to create, update, validate and share accounts in Domo. If you would like to manage a large number of accounts at scale from agencies or other 3rd party vendors that you currently manage individually through the Data Center in Domo, the Accounts API makes that possible.
Note
The Accounts API will only return information for accounts you own or for accounts that have been shared with you in Domo.
