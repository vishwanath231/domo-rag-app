Domo's AI Service Layer enables developers to build AI capabilities into their Domo Apps. In particular, the AI Service Layer currently supports two services from within Apps:
Text Generation
Text-to-SQL
Image-to-Text
Domo allows you to configure which models power each of the services. For more on how that works, see this video.
You can also see example usage of the the Text Generation and the Text-to-SQL in the AI Domo Bricks currently available to download for free in the Domo AppStore.

};
domo
  .post(`/domo/ai/v1/text/generation`, body)
  .then((response) => console.log(response));
Arguments
PROPERTY NAME TYPE REQUIRED DESCRIPTION
input String Required The prompt you are sending to the model
promptTemplate Object Optional An override for the prompt template used in the service. It has one property template, which expects a string.
parameters Object Optional Used with the promptTemplate for additional customization. You can pass any key, value pair of strings. See examples below.
model String Optional The id of the model you'd like to use if you don't want to use the default model.
HTTP Request
POST /domo/ai/v1/text/generation HTTP/1.1

Accept: application/json
Request Body
The only required field in the request body is the input string, but you can provide additional properties in the request body to futher customize the text generation service. If you choose to use the promptTemplate property to override the default prompt template, you'll need to use ${input} into the template string to pass through the input of your prompt.
